2. Section and sub-section headings.
3. Math? (for foundations).
4. Read conclusions.
5. References.

### Answer

- *Category*: Type of paper?

- *Clarity*: Well written?

## Second pass

- Read thoroughly.
- What do you not understand, any questions?
- Look carefully at illustrations.
- Mark relevant unread references (further reading).

### You should be able to...

Grasp the content of the paper.
Summarize, with supporting evidence.

### Next step

(a) set the paper aside, hoping you don’t need to understand the material to be
    successful in your career,
(b) return to the paper later, perhaps after reading background material or
(c) persevere and go on to the third pass.

## Third pass

- *Re-create* the paper making the same assumptions as the authors.
- Challenge assumptions.
