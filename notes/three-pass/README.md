# [The three-pass approach][How to Read a Paper]

## First pass

1. Carefully read title, abstract and intro.
2. Section and sub-section headings.
3. Math? (for foundations).
4. Read conclusions.
5. References.

### Answer

- *Category*: Type of paper?
- *Context*: Related papers, theoretical bases.
- *Correctness*: Valid assumptions?
- *Contribuitions*: What?
- *Clarity*: Well written?

## Second pass

- Read thoroughly.
- What do you not understand, any questions?
- Look carefully at illustrations.
- Mark relevant unread references (further reading).

### You should be able to...

Grasp the content of the paper.
Summarize, with supporting evidence.

### Next step

(a) set the paper aside, hoping you donâ€™t need to understand the material to be
    successful in your career,
(b) return to the paper later, perhaps after reading background material or
(c) persevere and go on to the third pass.

## Third pass

- *Re-create* the paper making the same assumptions as the authors.
- Challenge assumptions.
- Compare it to how you would have done it.
- Jot down ideas for future work.

### You should be able to...

Reconstruct the structure from memory.
Identify strong and weak points.
Pinpoint implicit assumptions, missing citations and potential issues.
